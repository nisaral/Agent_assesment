üìä Performance Benchmarks
Nisar conducted benchmarks to ensure the app performs efficiently, especially on resource-constrained platforms like Render‚Äôs free tier.
Local Testing (Windows 11, 16 GB RAM, i5 Processor)

Startup Time: ~5 seconds (Docker container startup + Uvicorn).
Request Latency (Text Query, AAPL:100,MSFT:50):
Average: 2.3 seconds (includes API calls to yfinance, NewsAPI, and Gemini).
Peak: 3.1 seconds (during high network latency).


Request Latency (Audio Query, 3-second .wav):
Average: 4.8 seconds (includes Deepgram STT, tone analysis, and TTS).


Memory Usage: ~350 MB (post-GloVe removal, down from 1.2 GB).

Render Free Tier (512 MB RAM, 0.5 CPU)

Startup Time: ~8 seconds.
Request Latency (Text Query):
Average: 3.5 seconds.


Request Latency (Audio Query):
Average: 6.2 seconds.


Memory Usage: ~400 MB (stable, fits within 512 MB limit).
Throughput: ~10 requests/minute (limited by API rate limits and free tier constraints).

PythonAnywhere Free Tier

Startup Time: ~10 seconds (manual Uvicorn start).
Request Latency (Text Query):
Average: 4.0 seconds.


Request Latency (Audio Query):
Average: 7.0 seconds.
